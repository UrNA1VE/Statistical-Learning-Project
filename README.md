# Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction by Machine Learning Methods

The project is a binary classification about predicting whether previous insurance customers would be interested in the vehicle insurance provided by the same company, which will be discussed in detail in part 1. In the second part, we started with focusing on the basic distribution of the data set, and several data argumentation methods were taken into consideration according what we discovered. In the next part, we implemented two simple machine learning approaches, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Furthermore, we tried some sophisticated machine learning methods, including tree methods and the linear SVM, it appeared that the results were stuck at some threshold. In the last part, we attempted the neural network, and found the results were still the same as before, so in conclusion, we believed the best results we can get from this data set has approximately total accuracy = 0.75 and f1 score for the minority class = 0.45 unless there are some more specific and appropriate data argumentation methods for this problem
